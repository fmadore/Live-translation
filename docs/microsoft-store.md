# Microsoft Store submission

**Next target: 1.7.0 / MSIX 1.7.0.0, prepared; not tagged or submitted.** The last confirmed
Store release is 1.6.0 (MSIX 1.6.0.0), confirmed live by the maintainer on 6 October 2026.
1.6.1 was published on GitHub only and will not be submitted; 1.7.0 supersedes it and carries
its icon and interface changes. See the [current handoff](store-updates.md#release-170-handoff),
[listing copy](store-listing.md) and [Partner Center walkthrough](partner-center-walkthrough.md).

## Product and certification approach

Whisper gives real local speech recognition without an account or API key: the user downloads
a verified multilingual model once, then captions microphone or system audio offline, in the
spoken language or translated into English. CPU speed, model choice and language affect
latency and accuracy. Optional cloud translation and subtitles
need the user's provider account, key and network connection, with possible usage charges.
Every localized description discloses these dependencies at the start.

New installations open on **Whisper**, with Base and automatic language detection selected.
The user chooses Download model and then Start; no download or capture starts automatically.
Existing saved setups are preserved on upgrade. The English/French scripted demo remains a
setup-free way to check the overlay and export flow, and must always be labelled as a demo,
never as speech recognition.

1.0.3 failed certification because Start Subtitles did not work on the review device. 1.0.5
removed Windows AI Speech/ML and the Windows speech recognizer, and introduced the demo. Whisper
(1.6.0) is a different CPU implementation, so those failures do not describe it.

Since 1.7.0, Whisper is built for AVX2 on x64 and for dot-product instructions on ARM64, and
checks the processor before any of its code runs. On an x64 processor without AVX2, such as
some budget Celeron and Pentium Silver PCs, Whisper is listed as unavailable with the reason and
a selected Whisper, including the first-launch default, becomes the built-in demo. A clean
install on a reviewer's PC therefore always opens on something that starts. The listing
requirements and certification notes say so; see
[processor requirements](local-whisper.md#processor-requirements).

Review the current [Microsoft Store policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/publish/store-policies)
when submitting: metadata must describe dependencies and costs accurately, advertised features
must work on supported devices, and reviewers need a usable test path. The certification notes
provide Whisper setup and the demo fallback. Resolve access needed to test cloud features
before submission; a passing local check does not imply certification.

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Manifests and lockfiles agree on 1.7.0; both MSIX manifests and the combined bundle
  report 1.7.0.0 and the assigned identity, and both packages carry the wave-to-words icon
  assets introduced in 1.6.1.
- [ ] Both signed native packages are installed and exercised on their target hardware.
- [ ] Clean-install Whisper model download, verification, cancellation/removal and offline
  restart work without API keys. Test English and French; record non-Latin language checks.
- [ ] First launch selects Whisper / Base / automatic detection without starting a download
  or audio capture. An upgrade preserves an existing cloud or scripted-demo selection. On an
  x64 PC without AVX2, if one is available, Whisper is listed as unavailable and the demo is
  selected.
- [ ] Whisper translation into English with Small works offline on x64 and ARM64; any caption
  language but English is refused.
- [ ] Real microphone, system and application capture work; a failed source preserves captions.
- [ ] Whisper Pause admits no new audio; existing backlog can finish. Stop drains; confirmed
  discard shows the incomplete-transcript notice. Export after completion contains the tail.
- [ ] Cloud transcription and translation work with suitable credentials, including a
  non-EN/FR target, two targets, original speech where supplied, and Pause/Resume.
- [ ] Scripted demo starts with no hardware, network or credentials, in English and French.
- [ ] Overlay placement, its restore across launches and mixed-DPI displays, all reading
  modes, RTL text, filler list, profiles and shortcuts pass the
  [layout](caption-layout.md#release-verification) and [accessibility](accessibility.md) checks.
- [ ] Text/Markdown/SRT/VTT export, history, recovery, quit prompts and tray behavior work under package identity.
- [ ] Windows App Certification Kit passes on the final packages.
- [ ] EN/FR/DE copy, final-package screenshots and the public privacy policy match this version.

Previous release checks are historical evidence, not sign-off for new binaries.

## Package identity and signing

The Store signs accepted packages. Local testing needs signed inner MSIX packages and a
trusted matching certificate; signing only the outer bundle is insufficient. Follow
[MSIX packaging](packaging-msix.md) and use a test account/machine if a Store-signed install
would conflict. Do not remove an existing Store installation or its data as a build step.
