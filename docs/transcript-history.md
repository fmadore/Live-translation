# Transcript history

Implements [issue #81](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/81).

Open **Settings → Transcript history** in the operator window.
Enable **Automatically save sessions locally** before starting a meeting. This is off by
default. Enabling it mid-session saves subsequent finalized lines; it does not retroactively
archive the transcript already in memory.

Each Start creates a separate session. Finalized lines are progressively saved to a flushed,
atomically replaced JSON file in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\io.github.fmadore.live-translation\history\<session-id>.json`.
The first line is written at once; after that, new lines are saved at most every 5 seconds
rather than after every caption (1.5.1). Stop, quit, retry and the next Start write anything
still waiting immediately. Stop drains and saves trailing partial text before finishing the
session. A crash leaves the last successfully saved snapshot available, which can miss up to
the last 5 seconds of lines. Empty sessions create no file.

A session that ends by itself — every source stops, for example after a provider error — is
finished at that moment, so its recorded duration does not run on until the next Start, Stop
or quit. While the History tab is open during a session, its list refreshes at most every 5
seconds; Refresh, rename and delete still update it immediately.

The session list opens automatically and shows start date/time, duration, and known language information. Source
speech is labelled auto-detected when the provider does not report its language. Demonstration
and rehearsal sources have known languages. Unfinished sessions show duration through the last
save. Select a session to read its raw captions and available source transcription, copy it, or
export Markdown, plain text, WebVTT or SRT through the existing Save As dialog. Timed formats
require valid cue timing. Browsing and exporting history never replaces the active transcript.

History remains after clearing the active transcript, export, quitting, and disabling automatic
history. Use **Delete**, then **Delete permanently**, to remove a session. Deleting the current
session prevents further history writes for that session; the next Start creates a new one.
Unreadable records are shown individually and remain deletable. Save failures stay visible with
a retry action; pending failed sessions are retained in memory until retried or the app exits.

There is no automatic expiry and no upload. Files are unencrypted local text. No audio, keys,
device names or application identities are saved. History and the optional single recovery
copy are independent. See [privacy](privacy.md).

## File format

Each session is one file under app-local data/history, named by its UUID. Since
24 September 2026 the file is a log, one JSON record per line:

1. a header — `version: 2`, the id, start time, mode, languages and title;
2. one `{"line": …}` record per finalized line, oldest first;
3. a progress record — `savedAt`, `durationMs`, `endedAt` — after each write;
4. a `{"title": …}` record for each rename.

The latest progress and title records win. The first write of a session, and any write after
a failure, replaces the file whole through the flushed staging file as before; every later
write goes through `append_history`, which adds only the lines that are new and flushes them.
Appending never creates a file, so a log never starts without its header, and a record torn by
a failed write is closed off with a newline before the next one; the reader skips it.

The previous format rewrote the whole session object on every save. At about ten finalized
lines a minute the 5-second write interval coalesced roughly one line per write, so a
three-hour session rewrote and flushed about half a gigabyte. Files in that format are still
read and renamed.

## Verification

Automated coverage includes opt-in behavior, progressive writes, raw text preservation,
separate session timelines, trailing partials, duration finalization, restart/readback, atomic
replacement, interrupted writes, write failures and retry, corruption, deletion races, path
validation, operator-only command permissions, and the history UI's copy/export/delete actions.

Native release acceptance should also exercise the built-in demonstration with history enabled,
restart the packaged app, reopen two sessions, export and delete one, and confirm the other is
still available. Abruptly end a disposable demo run and check its last saved snapshot. No paid
provider call is needed for these checks.

## Titles and search

New in **1.4.0**.

Saved sessions can be renamed (up to 120 characters); a blank title restores the date label.
Titles are stored inside the existing local session JSON, including when the active session
continues receiving captions. Older files without titles remain readable. Changing a title
never replaces or edits caption text.

Search matches session titles, caption text and available source text. Date bounds include
both selected local calendar days. The caption-language filter uses the translation target,
or the known source language for subtitles; automatically detected languages remain marked
unknown rather than guessed. Filters do not delete sessions or change export contents.

In 1.4.1, the selected session appears beside the list (below it in narrow windows).
Use **Clear filters** to reset search, date and language constraints. Rename, copy, export
and confirmed deletion are grouped with the selected session.

Enter date bounds in year-month-day order, or use the calendar button. The format hint
follows the interface language: **YYYY-MM-DD** (English), **AAAA-MM-JJ** (French),
and **JJJJ-MM-TT** (German); for example, `2026-09-20` in every language.
Invalid dates show a localized error and do not replace the last valid filter.
Both bounds include the whole selected local day. Clear a field to remove that bound,
or use **Clear filters** to reset the applied search, dates and language.
The calendar popup is a native browser/WebView control; its presentation can follow
the host's regional settings independently of the translated text field.
