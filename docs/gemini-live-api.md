# Gemini Live API

Two Gemini models share one `BidiGenerateContent` socket and one API key. For subtitles without a
cloud connection, see [local Whisper](local-whisper.md).

| Model | Status | Mode it serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview` | Preview | Translated captions |
| `gemini-3.5-transcribe-live` | Stable | Same-language subtitles |

Re-verified 27 August 2026 against Google’s
[Live translation guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/live-translate)
(last updated 2026-07-23), the
[Live transcription guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/live-transcribe)
(last updated 2026-08-26), the [model list](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) and
the [Live API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/live). Live Translate is still preview with
no stable equivalent (Transcribe went GA), so re-check it before an event; its wire format is
unchanged since the 12 August 2026 verification.

## Gemini 3.5 Live Translate

### Connection and audio

```text
wss://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ws/google.ai.generativelanguage.v1beta.GenerativeService.BidiGenerateContent?key=<API_KEY>
```

- Model: `gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview`, sent as `models/...` in setup.
- Input: mono PCM16 LE at 16 kHz, base64 in `realtimeInput.audio`.
- Output modality: `AUDIO`. The app discards model audio and displays
  `outputTranscription`; this can still incur audio-output charges.

### Setup

```json
{
  "setup": {
    "model": "models/gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview",
    "generationConfig": {
      "responseModalities": ["AUDIO"],
      "translationConfig": {
        "targetLanguageCode": "en",
        "echoTargetLanguage": true
      }
    },
    "inputAudioTranscription": {},
    "outputAudioTranscription": {}
  }
}
```

The SDKs flatten both levels into one `LiveConnectConfig`, but on the wire they are distinct:

- `inputAudioTranscription` and `outputAudioTranscription` are fields of
  `BidiGenerateContentSetup` itself ([Live API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/live)).
  Nested under `generationConfig`, they make the server reject the whole session with
  `Unknown name "inputAudioTranscription" at 'setup.generation_config': Cannot find field.`
- `translationConfig` *is* a `generationConfig` field, and is Gemini Developer API only —
  the SDKs raise on it in Enterprise/Vertex mode.

Both placements are pinned by `python-genai`'s converter tests (`tests/live/test_live.py`:
`test_bidi_setup_to_api_with_input_transcription`,
`test_bidi_setup_to_api_with_translation_config`). Older revisions used
`realtimeInput.mediaChunks`; that shape is not used here.

### Streaming and events

```json
{
  "realtimeInput": {
    "audio": {
      "mimeType": "audio/pcm;rate=16000",
      "data": "<base64 PCM16>"
    }
  }
}
```

- `serverContent.inputTranscription.text` is source-language monitor text.
- `serverContent.outputTranscription.text` is translated caption text.
- `echoTargetLanguage` stays enabled so speech already in the target language still appears
  in the caption stream; this is essential for bilingual meetings.
- `serverContent.turnComplete` finalizes and advances the per-source turn.
- `goAway` triggers an immediate planned reconnect; see [the ten-minute cap](#the-ten-minute-cap).
- A provider `error` becomes a terminal operator-visible status instead of a silent log.

## Gemini 3.5 Transcribe Live

Same endpoint, audio frame and key; a subtitle engine rather than a translator, so the setup
message and transcription fields differ.

### Setup

```json
{
  "setup": {
    "model": "models/gemini-3.5-transcribe-live",
    "generationConfig": {
      "responseModalities": ["TEXT"]
    },
    "inputAudioTranscription": {
      "languageCodes": [],
      "mode": "SMART"
    }
  }
}
```

- `responseModalities: ["TEXT"]` separates the transcription pipeline from a live agent: no
  generated audio to discard, no output sidecar to read.
- `inputAudioTranscription` is a `BidiGenerateContentSetup` field here too, and carries
  configuration rather than being an empty marker.
- `languageCodes: []` enables automatic language identification across utterances, including
  code-switching — the right default for a bilingual room. The guide's table lists 84 entries:
  **83 distinct BCP-47 codes and 77 distinct languages** once locale variants collapse
  (`en-US`/`en-GB`/`en-IN`, `bn-BD`/`bn-IN`, …). User-facing copy therefore says "over 70
  languages", not "100+".
- `mode: "SMART"` removes fillers and false starts, resolves spoken self-corrections, and
  applies punctuation and casing; an audience reading an overlay needs that more than every
  "um". `VERBATIM` (Google's default) is the alternative, not an extra setting. SMART rules out
  word-level annotations, which the app does not use. Google's
  [15 September 2026 audio announcement](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/developers-tools/build-real-time-voice-applications-gemini-audio/)
  confirms the disfluency removal; its Gemini 3.8 Live models are conversational audio models,
  not replacements for this integration.
- `customVocabulary` (up to 1,000 terms, best under 100) is available and not yet wired up.

### Streaming and events

The audio frame is the one live translate uses — 16 kHz mono PCM16 LE, base64 in
`realtimeInput.audio`, 100 ms chunks.

- `serverContent.interimInputTranscription.text` is a speculative partial hypothesis, revised
  as the speaker talks.
- `serverContent.inputTranscription.text` is the finalized, authoritative transcript for one
  speech segment, emitted when the speaker pauses.

**Both describe the same segment, so each replaces the caption buffer rather than extending
it.** Live translate appends `inputTranscription` deltas; doing so here would repeat every
revised hypothesis on screen. One finalized segment becomes one transcript line.

When a message carries both, the finalized text wins. An empty final or segment close retracts
an all-filler speculative caption rather than keeping it as speech, and the front end discards
the pending empty turn (regression-tested; no live probe was run for this 1.4.0 change). The
local [Hide filler words](caption-layout.md#hide-filler-words) filter is separate.

`{"realtimeInput":{"audioStreamEnd":true}}` is sent on close so a last segment can still
arrive during the shared runner's drain window.

### What the wire does that the guide does not mention

Found with `live_probe` (below) against the real endpoint on 27 August 2026:

- **Replies arrive as WebSocket _binary_ frames carrying UTF-8 JSON.** The guide's browser
  sample hides the difference; a client matching only text frames has setup accepted and then
  hears nothing. `realtime.rs` decodes `Message::Binary` — check this first if a session ever
  appears to hang.
- **`generationComplete` closes a segment**, not the `turnComplete` the translate path sends.
  It lets the client finalize a segment that produced only a speculative hypothesis.
- **`setupComplete` *is* sent**, although the guide's sample never waits for one. Waiting is
  correct and matches the Live API contract.

### Segmentation is the model's, and it is not sentence-shaped

On the bundled twenty-second recording, continuous speech runs two sentences into one segment
without a space (`…Use this recording toThe overlay before…`), breaks can fall mid-word
(`…every sentence is` / `described and shown on screen…`, from "transcribed"), and segmentation
varies between runs on identical audio. A caption therefore grows until the model closes the
segment — on continuous speech, a paragraph. The client does not re-split: that would invent
sentence boundaries and make text still being revised jump. Voxtral's 900 ms idle finalization
gives shorter lines, a fair reason to prefer it for a speaker who rarely pauses.

### The ten-minute cap

> Live transcription sessions support continuous streaming for up to 10 minutes.

Mistral Voxtral has no such limit, so this is the one operational difference between the two
subtitle engines: a room session reconnects several times an hour.

`goAway` arrives before the cut, and both Gemini clients answer it with
`MessageControl::Handover`: a planned move, not a failure. After a connection that lasted at
least 30 seconds the runner finalizes the in-flight turn, keeps the source Running, reconnects
at once with no backoff, and sends the up-to-half-second of audio queued meanwhile, in order,
instead of discarding it as a stall's backlog. The remaining gap is the new connection's TLS
handshake and setup round trip. A `goAway` straight after connecting still backs off, so a
server refusing the session is never hammered. Opening the new socket before closing the old
one would remove the gap; the runner holds one socket per client today.

Speaker diarization and word-level timestamps are not available over the Live API; they belong
to the non-streaming `gemini-3.5-transcribe` model, which takes uploaded files and cannot serve
this app.

## Re-verifying against the live endpoint

Serialization tests pin both clients to the shapes above but cannot show the documentation is
right — and it is not everywhere: the translate guide still nests the transcription sidecars
under `generationConfig`. `gemini::transcribe::live_probe` sends the production setup, audio
frame and response types to Google with the bundled rehearsal recording and reports the
interim and finalized segments.

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=... cargo test -p live-translation --lib live_probe -- --ignored --nocapture
```

It is `#[ignore]`d, so CI never runs it or bills anyone. Run it before an event and after any
change to either setup message; it costs a few cents (about twenty seconds of audio). The key
comes from the environment or a `.env` at the repo root (`dotenvy` walks up from the crate
directory; copy `.env.example`). Its assertions concern the shape of the exchange, not the
words: setup is accepted, `generationComplete` arrives, and speculative updates outnumber
finalized segments — which is what makes replace-don't-append correct.

## Target-language catalog

Rechecked against the [live translation guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/live-translate)
on 2026-09-22 (page updated 2026-09-16): 78 languages / 79 codes. The app shows one Norwegian
row and sends `no`; `nb` is a search alias. The canonical catalog, with each code's provider
memberships, is `src/lib/languages.json`; generated Rust and TypeScript types share it. This is
documentation verification, not a live-speech pass; see [language coverage](language-coverage.md).
