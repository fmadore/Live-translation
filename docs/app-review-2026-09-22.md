# App review — 22 September 2026

Scope: a read-only review of version 1.5.0 covering refactoring, efficiency and visual design.
The review covered the Rust core, the frontend state modules, the Svelte component layer, CSS
and design tokens, the build and CI. The operator and overlay windows were also inspected in a
browser preview. Nothing was changed. Findings marked **verified** were rechecked against the
code by a second pass. Findings marked *unmeasured* rest on reading the code, not on profiling.

Baseline: `npm test` passes 356 tests in 42 files, and `npm run check` reports 0 errors and 0
warnings. `cargo clippy -W clippy::pedantic` reports 137 lib warnings; the meaningful ones are
listed under R-refactors.

The 5 September review ([archive](archive/app-review-2026-09-05.md)) closed its items. Nothing
below repeats them.

**Status (23 September 2026):** batches 1 and 2 were merged in
[#86](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/pull/86) as `a276b68` and ship in
[1.5.1](release-1.5.1.md). CI's Rust 1.98 Clippy flagged the new resampler's `chunks_exact(8)`,
which now uses `as_chunks::<8>()` (stable since the crate's 1.88 MSRV). Batch 3 was merged in
[#87](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/pull/87) as `fbaad4d`. Batch 4 is implemented
on `review/2026-09-22-batch4` (tracker below). The live D1 check passed before tagging; the
desktop checks for D5 and E2 are in the
[1.5.1 Store handoff](store-updates.md#release-151-handoff).

## Implementation tracker — batch 1

Batch 1 is the quick, low-risk group from §6. Status is updated as each item lands; notes
record what changed and how it was verified.

| Item | Change | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D2 | Only the topmost modal handles Escape/Tab | Done |
| D5 | `.env` and host overrides debug-only; per-provider settings | Done |
| D6 | Microphone and typeface selects use `ui/Select` | Done |
| D9 | Rail width cap reaches child components | Done |
| D3 (part) | Snapshot built in the queued job; history list refresh not per line | Done |
| E1 | `crate-type = ["rlib"]` | Done |
| E2 | Tray skips unchanged labels; command runs on the main thread | Done; desktop check pending |
| E4 | Borrowed caption text; no copy of Gemini binary frames | Done |
| E5 | Activity notes throttled per source | Done |
| E6 | History search index normalised once per session | Done |
| E8 | Bundle `.woff2` fonts only | Done |
| Dead code | `latestCaption`, `prepare_ondevice_model`, `const open`, duplicate locale push | Done |

### Batch 1 implementation notes

- **D2** — [`ModalPrompt.svelte`](../src/lib/ModalPrompt.svelte) keeps a module-level stack of
  open dialogs. Each dialog registers on mount and removes itself on teardown, and its window
  key handler returns early unless it is on top. The handler moved from `on:keydown` to
  `onkeydown`. The new [`ModalPrompt.svelte.test.ts`](../src/lib/ModalPrompt.svelte.test.ts)
  stacks a dialog under the unsaved prompt and covers three cases: Escape answers only the top
  dialog, a mid-cycle Tab is left alone, and the lower dialog gets the keyboard back when the
  top one closes. Two of the three tests fail with the guard removed.
- **D5** — `session.rs` gains `ProviderSettings::resolve(provider)`, which reads only the
  selected provider's variables. `*_WS_HOST` is honoured only when `debug_assertions` is on.
  Model overrides still apply in release, so a renamed model can be pinned without a new
  build. `lib.rs` loads `.env` in debug builds only, and `.env.example` says so. Three unit
  tests cover the fix: a malformed Mistral delay no longer blocks Gemini, model overrides and
  defaults combine, and host overrides depend on build type. The provider arms now match on
  the settings.
- **D6** — The microphone select is now `Field` + `Select`. It has a visible "Microphone
  device" label, like the output picker beside it. The typeface select is `Select` inside its
  existing label. Both duplicated `.select-row`/`.chevron` blocks and their weaker focus ring
  are gone. In the browser preview the selects are 38 px and 35 px tall (the typeface select
  was 12.5 px), with the shared 2 px `--focus` ring.
- **D9** — The cap is `.rail > :global(*)` with `max-width: 23.75rem`. Browser verification
  showed that the review's `:global` fix alone was not enough. `MeetingProfiles` sets a 12 px
  font, so `23.75em` capped it at 285 px beside 380 px siblings. `rem` resolves to the rail's
  own column width for every child. In the two-column layout at 1200 × 820, all rail children
  measure 325 px, the same as before.
- **D3 (part)** — `persist()` captures the session and takes a shallow snapshot when its queued
  job runs, so superseded appends copy nothing. `TranscriptHistory.svelte` refreshes on a
  revision at most every 5 s. Mount, Refresh, rename and delete still refresh immediately. A
  new fake-timer test sends five writes in a burst and expects one re-list after 5 s; it fails
  with the throttle set to zero. The dead `open` constant and its wrapper block were removed.
  The write throttle and JSONL format stay in batch 2.
- **E1** — `Cargo.toml` builds only `rlib`. A `cargo build --release --locked` passed in
  7 min 02 s and produced only `live-translation.exe` (5,178,368 bytes). The `.dll` and
  152 MB `.lib` still in `target/release/deps` date from a 20 September build. The time is not
  a before/after comparison, because dependencies were rebuilt in the same run.
- **E2** — `tray.rs` remembers the text and enabled state last written to each item and skips
  unchanged writes. During a session this means one status write per second instead of six.
  `set_tray_state` is now a sync command: Tauri runs those on the main thread, and
  `tauri-runtime-wry`'s `send_user_message` runs main-thread tasks inline, so there are no
  blocking round trips. The frontend is unchanged, because the core now does the
  de-duplication. The native tray still needs a desktop run.
- **E4** — `Caption<'a>` borrows the turn's text for the moment it is serialized, and binary
  frames are parsed with `std::str::from_utf8(&bytes)`.
- **E5** — `noteActivity` ignores a repeat of the same source and kind within 500 ms. The
  labels it feeds use a 3 s threshold.
- **E6** — `historySearch.ts` caches each listed session's NFKC-folded text in a `WeakMap`.
  Listed sessions are never mutated, because a rename re-lists them.
- **E8** — A `woff2-only` pre-transform in `vite.config.js` drops fontsource's `.woff`
  fallbacks before Vite resolves their URLs. The build output went from 1.2 MB (54 font files)
  to 782 KB (27 `.woff2`). In the browser preview, the five weights in use load from `.woff2`.
- **Dead code** — Removed:
  - the `latestCaption` store and its five writes;
  - the `prepare_ondevice_model` command, its permission, command-name entry, `tauri.ts`
    wrapper, `ondevice::prepare` and its no-op test;
  - the redundant `onMount` overlay push. The two language effects became one, so load sends
    one full overlay config instead of three.

Verification on 22 September 2026:

| `npm test` | 360 passed in 43 files (4 new) |
| `npm run check` | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `npm run format:check` | Passed |
| `npm run build` | Passed; 27 `.woff2`, no `.woff` |
| `cargo fmt --check` | Passed |

The tray (E2) and the release-only `.env`/host behaviour (D5) are covered by compilation and
unit tests only. They still need a desktop run.

## Implementation tracker — batch 2

Batch 1 was committed as `ea01dbf` on `review/2026-09-22`. Batch 2 covers audio and persistence.

| Item | Change | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | Windowed-sinc anti-alias filter with frequency-response tests | Done; live session checked 23 September |
| D3 | History writes from appends throttled; finish/flush write at once | Done |
| D4 | Stable overlay history capped; cleaned lead derived separately | Done |
| D7 | Sessions the core ends are finished in history | Done |
| D10 | Keep unwinding in release so thread-failure paths work | Done (decided 23 September) |

### Batch 2 implementation notes

- **D1** — [`resample.rs`](../src-tauri/src/audio/resample.rs) now low-pass filters with a
  Kaiser-windowed sinc designed at construction:
  - cutoff 0.45 × and transition 0.11 × the output rate, sized for 60 dB;
  - 99 taps for 48 → 16 kHz and 67 taps for 48 → 24 kHz;
  - linear interpolation to the output rate is kept.

  Only inputs that have an output are filtered, and at integer ratios only the sample the
  output lands on. That is about 1.6 M multiply-adds per second at 48 → 16 kHz, spread over
  eight accumulators so the dot product can vectorise. `LinearResampler` is renamed
  `Resampler`.

  Response measured through the Rust implementation, in dB:

  | 48 → 16 kHz | 3 kHz | 4 kHz | 6 kHz | 7 kHz | 10 kHz | 12 kHz |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Old one-pole cascade | −2.6 | −4.3 | −8.3 | −10.4 | −16.3 | −19.6 |
  | New windowed sinc | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | −3.1 | −87.0 | −80.3 |

  At 48 → 24 kHz it is flat to 9 kHz, −0.6 dB at 10 kHz, and ≤ −71 dB from 13 kHz. New tests
  cover:
  - passband level (±0.5 dB to 6 kHz at 16 kHz output, and to 9 kHz at 24 kHz);
  - alias rejection (≤ −55 dB);
  - 44.1 kHz input;
  - DC gain;
  - bit-identical output across block sizes and history compaction;
  - unfiltered upsampling.

  The test tone's phase is computed in f64, because an f32 phase adds noise near −55 dB.

  The rehearsal fixtures are 16 kHz, so they never pass through the downsampler and cannot
  serve as a before/after listening test. The effect on recognition accuracy still needs a
  live 48 kHz session with a provider.
- **D3** — `createHistoryCoordinator` writes a session's first appended line at once and then
  at most one append-triggered write per `HISTORY_WRITE_INTERVAL_MS` (5 s). `finish`, `flush`,
  `retry` and `begin` write anything waiting at once, and deleting the active session
  cancels it. Quit already flushes. A fake-timer test checks that five appends coalesce into
  one write after 5 s; it fails with the interval set to zero. A second test covers the
  immediate writes. JSONL remains an option if full-file rewrites every 5 s ever matter.
- **D4** — Stable reading's history is now trimmed only at a rendered line start.
  [`OverlayCaptionLine.svelte`](../src/routes/overlay/OverlayCaptionLine.svelte) renders the
  stable paragraph as one text node. Once more than 180 lines are hidden, it uses
  `firstOffsetOnLine` (`captionLayout.ts`) to find the start of the line that leaves 60 hidden
  lines, measured against the live layout, and hands that offset back. The overlay slices its
  history there. Measuring the paragraph directly avoids a double trim before the bound
  height catches up.

  Two measurements in Chromium, in the overlay's own font, decided this design:
  - Cutting 20,000 characters at a line start left all 80 remaining lines identical.
  - A cut at an arbitrary word did **not** reliably re-synchronise. In 60 random cuts across
    four width/size combinations, 6 never re-synchronised, one took 64 lines and several took
    over 20. A plain character cap could therefore re-wrap the lines being read.

  To make offsets map one-to-one, Stable reading now cleans each turn once as it joins the
  history. A later filler toggle therefore applies to new turns rather than re-wrapping every
  line already read; context carried in from another layout is cleaned on entry. Fit mode's
  cleaned lead is a separate `$derived`, recomputed per turn instead of per caption. Tests
  cover the offset search (including uneven lines) and the component's trim with a synthetic
  layout, which fails with trimming disabled. The preview renders Stable as a single text node
  with no console errors.
- **D7** — `stores.ts` tracks whether a source of the current run has reported an active
  state. When every source then ends on its own, `applyStatus` calls the new
  `endTranscriptSession()` (flush + finish). The flag matters because a drained session's
  Idle can arrive after `beginSession`. The core stops the old run before starting the new
  one, so that stale Idle always precedes the new run's first active status and is ignored.
  `sessionController.stop`, `prepareClose` and `beginSession` all use the same helper.
  Two integration tests cover this: a failed run's record is closed, and a new run survives
  the old run's late Idle. Each test fails when its half of the fix is disabled.
- **D10** — Measured on the release build: dropping `panic = "abort"` grows
  `live-translation.exe` from 5,178,368 to 9,228,288 bytes (+78%). Compressed with gzip -9 it
  goes from 2.14 MB to 3.06 MB (+43%). That is far more than the review's "few percent"
  estimate, so the decision went back to the maintainer. On 23 September they chose
  resilience over size: `panic = "abort"` is removed, and a comment in `Cargo.toml` records
  why and what it costs. The unwinding release build was the one measured above, and it
  built and linked cleanly.

## Implementation tracker — batch 3

Batch 3 is structure: R1, R2, R6, R7, R9, then R11 and R12 in the order given. It changes no
behaviour except the two fixes noted under R6 and R9. Each item is its own commit on
`review/2026-09-22-batch3`.

| Item | Change | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | Pure provider handlers returning a `CaptionUpdate`; handler tests for all four providers | Done |
| R2 | `SessionManager::start` split into shared capture, level, join and client helpers | Done; desktop run pending |
| R9 | Contract tests for commands, events and serde enum values; unions declared once | Done |
| R7 | One `persisted` helper and storage policy for every preference | Done |
| R6 | One appearance schema, `PRESETS` table and `applyAppearance` | Done |
| R11 | Operator page split into 10 components, 4 primitives and 5 script modules | Done |
| R12 | Overlay route split into captions, placement, move chrome and fixtures | Done; move mode needs a desktop run |

### Batch 3 implementation notes

- **R1** — `RealtimeProtocol::handle_message` no longer takes an `AppHandle`. It fills the
  turn accumulator and returns a `CaptionUpdate` (`None`, `Interim`, `Final`) in its
  `MessageOutcome`; `handle_socket_message` emits it through `apply_caption` and advances a
  final turn. A `test_support::Harness` drives a handler through that same path. Thirteen new
  tests cover Gemini Translate, OpenAI, Mistral and Gemini Transcribe. Mistral's
  done-after-deltas guard now has a test, and it fails with the guard removed. Interim
  coalescing was left out: it would change caption timing, and testability did not need it.
- **R2** — `start` is about 40 lines. It uses `validate_start`, `session_origins` /
  `live_origins` and `CaptureTarget::run` (shared with the preflight probe). It also uses
  `spawn_level_forwarder`, `join_threads`, `ProviderSettings::spawn_client` with a generic
  `ClientIo::spawn_realtime`, and `SessionBuilder::add_source`. Three tests cover source order,
  the rehearsal override and device-id-before-name selection.
- **R9** — `contract.test.ts` checks that `tauri.ts` wraps exactly the commands in
  `command_names.rs`. It checks that `EVT` matches the `events` module plus the two
  webview-only overlay events. It also checks seven TS unions against their serde enums,
  applying `rename` and `rename_all` as serde does. Each union is now one exported `as const`
  list with the type derived from it; `document.ts`, `reading.ts`, `history.ts`,
  `LiveActivity` and `OverlayConfig.locale` reuse the lists. Found while splitting the page
  (R11): `StatusUpdate.message` was typed `string`, but the core sends an `AppError`. It is
  now `AppError | string`.
- **R7** — `persisted.ts` has `readStored`, `writeStored`, `readFlag`, `persisted`,
  `persistedFlag` and `persistedWith`. None of them throws when storage is absent, blocked or
  full. All 14 persisted stores use them, and so do the overlay's loaders. The four boolean
  loaders that only `stores.ts` used are gone. Six tests.
- **R6** — `appearance.ts` owns the eight settings. Presets now apply in one push instead of
  four. Its tests found a real fault: High contrast asked for scrim opacity 1, the clamp
  stored the 0.95 maximum, and the pressed check compared against 1, so the button never read
  as pressed. The preset now names `SCRIM_OPACITY_MAX`. Twelve tests.
- **R11** — The prerequisite shared classes moved to `app.css`. Then, in the review's order,
  these came out of the page:
  - `SettingsDialog` with `ui/Tabs`;
  - `OperatorTitlebar`, `SessionControls`, `DeviceRecoveryBanner` and `LiveTurns`;
  - `PreflightChecklist` with `ui/ChecklistRow`, which `ApiKeyPanel` now uses too;
  - `LiveRail`;
  - `SetupSheet` with `ui/ChoiceButton` and `ui/LanguageCard`.

  The script modules are `sessionClock`, `setupActions`, `deviceFailure`, `recoveryOffer`
  and `nativeSync`. The page went from 2,799 to 643 lines. The only visual change is the
  saved-key sentence's line height, from 1.35 to 1.3.
- **R12** — The overlay page went from 956 to 288 lines. `overlayCaptions.svelte.ts` holds
  the caption state, expiry and presenter, and is testable without fonts or a
  `ResizeObserver` (11 tests). `overlayPlacement.svelte.ts` holds move mode and a pure key map
  (5 tests). `OverlayMoveChrome.svelte` and `overlayFixtures.ts` complete the split.
  `captionColour.test.ts` reads all three stylesheets that paint the window.

How the page split was checked: a browser-preview script captured the operator window before
the split. It recorded normalized markup (attributes sorted, generated ids and scoping classes
removed) and 24 computed properties of every element. It covered 12 states: idle demo,
translate and subtitles; running with two speakers; and each settings tab. It drove the
page's own stores. Every step was compared against that baseline. After each step the only
differences were the renamed tab-list class, animation phase and hover state. The overlay
preview was compared the same way: default content, and the Arabic and Japanese samples.
Unused rules were removed by matching svelte-check's unused-selector report.

Batch 3 verification on 23 September 2026:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | 436 passed in 53 files (68 new) |
| `npm run check` | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `npm run format:check` | Passed |

| `cargo test --locked --all-features` | 96 passed, 2 ignored (16 new) |
| Browser preview, operator window (12 states) and overlay (3 states) | Markup and computed styles identical to before the split |

A desktop run should confirm a live session start/stop, rehearsal, the preflight audio test,
device recovery and overlay move mode (lock, cancel, nudge, snap). These paths are covered by
unit and component tests, but not in the native window.

## Implementation tracker — batch 4

Batch 4 is the design system: V1–V4 token consolidation, V5–V7 layout and buttons, then V8.
Each item is its own commit on `review/2026-09-22-batch4`, except V5 and V6, which share the
rewritten session controls. V7 went before V5, because the merged toolbar is built from its
buttons, and V3 went last, once the markup it spaces had settled.

| Item | Change | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | Seven type roles in place of sixteen pixel-named steps | Done |
| V2 | Four text levels, three surfaces, three lines; legacy names removed | Done |
| V4 | Overlay chrome on tokens; no hex literal in any component stylesheet | Done; move mode needs a desktop run |
| V7 | One `ToolButton` with variants and sizes for every button | Done |
| V5 | One toolbar in place of the title bar and the Start strip | Done; native frame needs a desktop run |
| V6 | Shortcut table in `shortcuts.ts`; the key on Start and Stop, localised | Done |
| V3 | `--space-1…6` and radius tokens across the operator window | Done |
| V8 | Named swatches, 32px targets, dialog container queries, profile label | Done; store screenshots pending |

### Batch 4 implementation notes

- **V1** — `--type-caption` 11, `small` 12, `body` 13, `label` 14, `title` 17, `heading` 21
  and `display` 27px at 100%. The four 11px steps became `caption`. Half-pixel sizes moved to
  the role that names them, which is the next size up (11.5 → 12, 12.5 → 13, 13.5 → 14) with
  four exceptions: the select and the key field are `small` like the other fields, and the
  intro and stage hint are `body`. Start went from 15.5 to 14 to match Stop, the compact stage
  heading from 24 to 21, and the live caption from 29 to 27. `typeScale.test.ts` pins the
  ramp, keeps every step at least a pixel apart, and now covers the overlay's move-mode chrome.
- **V2** — One scheme, one name per colour:
  - surfaces: `--surface-0` (ground; was `--bg` and `--surface-0`), `--surface-1` (panels and
    cards; was `--panel` and `--panel-2`) and `--surface-2` (raised; was `--surface-3`);
  - lines: `--line` (was `--hairline` and `--border-2`), `--line-strong` (was `--border`) and
    `--line-hover`;
  - text: `--text-bright`, `--text-body` (was `--text`), `--text-secondary` (was `--text-soft`
    and `--text-dim`) and `--text-muted` (was `--muted`, `--muted-2` and `--muted-3`);
  - `--accent-2` is gone, and `--focus` is an alias of `--accent-soft`.

  The muted level is `#8b93a1`, the brightest of the three it replaces. It is 5.47:1 on
  `--surface-2` and 4.53:1 on the amber wash, where `#848c99` (4.14) and `#7d858f` (3.76)
  failed. So former `--muted-3` text is 14 RGB steps brighter. Three selected-state rules
  that only swapped one muted grey for another were removed. The remaining grey literals
  (title bar, meter track, key-cap border, rail figures) now use tokens.

  Found on the way: the transcript log painted "Remote" blue and "Room" grey. That is the
  opposite of the live turns, and of the rule that blue is the room. Room is now
  `--room-soft`, and Remote is muted. `palette.test.ts` resolves aliases, pins the ramps and
  checks the muted level on every rgba wash over the ground and panel surfaces. Its mutation
  checks fail on the old grey and on an added `--text-dim`.
- **V4** — The move-mode region, pill and toolbar use tokens. The toolbar panel is
  `color-mix(in srgb, var(--surface-0) 96%, transparent)`. The misleading "does not inherit
  the operator's surfaces" comment is gone. The mint fill is one `--accent-fill` over
  `--accent` and a new `--accent-deep`, and `--on-accent` is checked against both ends. The
  brand mark, live rule and interim caret use tokens too. New guards in `palette.test.ts`:
  - no component stylesheet contains a hex literal (the two sample-slide colours and the
    placement sample caption are listed as content);
  - every text colour is a token or a system keyword;
  - the toolbar over a white slide stays darker than `--surface-2`, so the surface checks
    cover it.

  All three fail on the old chrome. Move mode cannot be reached in a browser, so the old and
  new `OverlayMoveChrome` were mounted side by side in the dev page. Their computed styles
  differed only in the collapsed greys, the toolbar edge (`#2f3540` → `--line-hover`) and
  the button fill (`#171b21` → `--surface-2`).
- **V7** — `ToolButton` takes `variant` (default, primary, ghost, danger, warn), `size` (sm,
  md, lg), `wide`, and a bindable `element` for the prompts that focus their safe answer. The
  look is written once under `.ui-tool`:
  - primary is `--accent-fill` everywhere, including the dialogs, which had a flat accent;
  - danger is a red tint that deepens on hover (an unfilled danger made the running Stop too
    faint);
  - warn is the amber call to action that the checklist and the hidden-overlay switch used;
  - a pressed toggle is the accent wash;
  - the rail's separate `.tool`, the two 0.45 disabled overrides and the local copies are gone.

  Converted: Start, Stop, Rehearse, the four dialogs' answers, the key panel, the transcript's
  Save as / Clear / Jump to latest, the checklist's test and placement buttons, Reset, the
  caption presets, `Stepper`, the rail and settings tools, device recovery, and the overlay's
  Snap and Lock. The transcript's borderless "quiet" Clear is now an ordinary ghost.
- **V5** — `OperatorToolbar` is
  `[brand] [Start] [Rehearse] … [status + elapsed] [gear]`. `SessionControls` is passed in
  as a snippet, and its buttons are items of the bar, so a narrow bar wraps between them. The
  pill's `margin-left: auto` keeps the status and gear at the right end. At 100% the chrome
  above the stage went from about 113px to 60px (56px after V3), so the stage gains about
  50px. The name stays as the window's `h1`, visually hidden, and the unused tagline was
  removed from the catalogs.
- **V6** — `SHORTCUT_KEYS` in `shortcuts.ts` is the one table: the listener matches it,
  `ariaKeyShortcut` gives `aria-keyshortcuts`, and `keyLabel` prints it with `$t.keys`.
  English shows `Ctrl+Shift+Space`, French `Ctrl+Maj+Espace` and German
  `Strg+Umschalt+Leertaste`. Start and Stop carry the key as `aria-hidden` secondary text and
  announce it through `aria-keyshortcuts`. An `em` container query (`48em`) drops the printed
  copy when the bar would otherwise wrap. With it, the bar stays one 132px row at 225% in all
  three languages at 1200 × 820; without it, German Start alone was 820px wide and the bar
  took four rows. A `Kbd` primitive draws every key cap, the F2 hint and the Settings list read
  the same table, and `rail.flipKey` is gone. Tests: the table round-trips through the
  listener, and ARIA and localised labels are pinned. Component tests check that the key is
  on Start and Stop but outside their names, and that the toolbar keeps one `h1`.
- **V3** — `--space-1…6` is 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 32px at 100%, in `rem`. There are also
  `--radius-sm` (chips, key caps, meter tracks) and `--radius-pill`. About 160 padding, margin
  and gap declarations moved to the nearest step: ties round down for gaps and control padding,
  and up for space between blocks. Every change is 6px or less, except the stage's left
  gutter (38 → 32px). Control heights are `min-height`: 32, 36 and 40px for sm, md and lg
  buttons, with fields at 36. Pixels remain only for optical nudges and for the overlay's
  caption layout, which the fitting code measures. `spacing.test.ts` holds every padding,
  margin, gap and radius to the scales. The overflow scan found the transcript header
  squeezing its buttons at 225% in French and German, so the header now wraps.
- **V8** —
  - Swatches: `TEXT_SWATCHES` / `SCRIM_SWATCHES` are named from the catalog (Mint, Pale
    yellow, Navy …) instead of read out as hex. A chosen swatch has an inset mint ring,
    parted from the colour by a dark one, instead of an outline identical to the focus ring.
  - Small targets: Reset and Move overlay reached 32px through V7. The appearance and overlay
    steppers, the dialog close button, the transcript format select and the key field are
    32px too.
  - Dialog breakpoints: `ModalPrompt`'s box is a `dialog` inline-size container. The
    appearance layout and the history filters ask it in `em` (40em), so they have two columns
    at 100% and 150% and one at 225%.
  - Label: the profile picker is named by its visible "Meeting profiles" label.
  - Store screenshots: still to be re-captured from an MSIX. All five are now out of date; see
    [store screenshots](store-screenshots/README.md).

How batch 4 was checked: the batch 3 harness captured normalized markup and 30 computed
properties of every element. It covered eight states (idle demo, translate and subtitles;
running with two speakers; each settings tab) in English, French and German at 100% and
225%, before any change. After each item, the diff against the previous step was grouped by
property and by old → new value, and every pair had to be one the item intended. V1 was
compared in all six language and scale combinations, the later token steps in English at
100%:

- V1 changed only font sizes and what follows from them;
- V2 changed only the planned colour pairs;
- V4 changed only the brand mark and the live rule in the operator window;
- V3 changed only spacing and radii.

V5–V8 changed structure, so their checks were targeted. The bar's geometry was measured in
all three languages at 100% and 225%, and in English at 150%. Below the bar, the diff showed only the new key
caps. An overflow scan found no clipped or off-screen text in the eight states × three
languages at 100%, 150% and 225% at 1200 × 820, or at 100% and 225% at the 980 × 660 minimum
window.

Batch 4 verification on 23 September 2026:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm test` | 457 passed in 55 files (21 new) |
| `npm run check` | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `npm run format:check` | Passed |
| `npm run build` | Passed |
| `npm run check:languages` | Passed |
| Rust | No changes in `src-tauri`; not re-run |
| Browser preview, operator window (8 states × EN/FR/DE × 100%/225%) | Only intended properties changed at each step; no overflow at 100%, 150% or 225% |
| Overlay move chrome, old and new mounted side by side | Only the planned colour changes |

A desktop run should confirm the toolbar under the native frame and Narrator reading
`aria-keyshortcuts` on Start and Stop. In a contrast theme, it should check the primary's
dropped gradient, the danger tint and the swatch ring. It should also check move mode in the
real overlay window. The five Store screenshots per language need re-capturing from the MSIX.

## 1. Defects found while reviewing

These are behavioural problems, not style issues, so they go first.

| ID | Priority | Finding | Suggested change | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | High | **Anti-alias filter muffles speech** (verified). [`audio/resample.rs:21-24`](../src-tauri/src/audio/resample.rs) cascades four one-pole low-passes at 0.45 × output rate. For 48 → 16 kHz (Gemini, Gemini Transcribe, Mistral): −2.6 dB at 3 kHz, −4.3 dB at 4 kHz, −10.4 dB at 7 kHz. Aliasing content at 10–12 kHz is only down 16–20 dB. Providers receive roughly telephone-bandwidth audio with folded sibilants. The effect on recognition accuracy is *unmeasured*. | Replace with 2–3 Butterworth biquads (4th/6th order), or a 32–64-tap polyphase FIR that also replaces linear interpolation (48→16 and 48→24 are integer ratios). Add passband/stopband tests at 2/4/6 kHz and 10/12/15 kHz. Compare against the rehearsal fixtures before shipping. | M |
| D2 | High | **Nested dialogs trap the keyboard** (verified). Every [`ModalPrompt`](../src/lib/ModalPrompt.svelte) installs its own window `keydown` handler (line 90). Nothing closes Settings when the window's X or tray Quit opens a quit prompt. With both open, one Escape dismisses both. Tab is pulled into Settings and then back to the prompt's first button, so **Discard is unreachable from the keyboard**. | Keep a module-level stack in `<script module>` so only the topmost modal handles keys. Alternatively, close Settings before any quit prompt opens. Migrate `on:keydown` to `onkeydown` at the same time. | S |
| D3 | High (opt-in feature) | **History write amplification** (verified). [`history.ts:129-135`](../src/lib/history.ts) copies the line array twice per final caption. `persist()` then serialises and fsyncs the whole session file each time. Over a 2,000-line (≈3 h) session that is ≈0.5 GB written; at 5,000 lines ≈3.3 GB. With the History tab open, every write also bumps `historyRevision`, and [`TranscriptHistory.svelte:83-88`](../src/lib/TranscriptHistory.svelte) re-lists and decodes every stored session. | Build the snapshot inside the queued job. Throttle append-triggered writes to ≈5 s, with `finish`/`flush` forcing a write. Bump the revision only on begin/finish/rename/delete/retry. A later option is an append-only JSONL format. | S → L |
| D4 | Medium | **Stable reading keeps unbounded overlay history** (verified). In Stable mode, [`overlay/+page.svelte:263-266`](../src/routes/overlay/+page.svelte) appends every turn with no cap, and `scheduleExpiry` returns early (line 181). History is only cleared when the whole session stops. `lines` re-runs `cleanSpeech` over the full history on every caption (≈4 ms at 187k characters vs 0.2 ms at the 12k Fit cap). The overlay then re-lays out one large `<p>`. | Cap Stable history in large whole-turn chunks, enough for a few viewports. Move the cleaned lead into its own `$derived` that depends only on `history[origin]` and `hideFillers`. | S–M |
| D5 | Medium | **Dev overrides active in release builds** (verified). [`lib.rs:86`](../src-tauri/src/lib.rs) calls `dotenvy::dotenv()` unconditionally. That search covers the working directory and its parents. [`session.rs:183-204`](../src-tauri/src/session.rs) honours `*_WS_HOST`, so a stray `.env` can redirect an API key to another host. Those lines also read all nine provider variables for every provider: a malformed `MISTRAL_TARGET_STREAMING_DELAY_MS` stops a Gemini session from starting. | Gate `.env` loading and host overrides behind `cfg(debug_assertions)`. Resolve only the selected provider's settings (`ProviderSettings::resolve(provider)`). | S |
| D6 | Medium | **Weak focus ring on two selects** (verified). `.select-row select:focus-visible` in [`+page.svelte:2174`](../src/routes/+page.svelte) and [`CaptionAppearance.svelte:291`](../src/lib/CaptionAppearance.svelte) replaces the shared ring with `--accent-border` (42 % alpha), about 2.7:1 over `--panel-2`. The CSS block is duplicated verbatim in both files. Its padding sits on the wrapper, so the clickable select is only **12.5 px tall** in a 34 px box. | Use the existing [`ui/Select`](../src/lib/ui/Select.svelte) primitive for the microphone and typeface selects, and delete both `.select-row` blocks. | S |
| D7 | Medium | **Sessions ended by the core are not finished in history.** `applyStatus` settles the clock when the last source ends ([`stores.ts:89-108`](../src/lib/stores.ts)) but never calls `sessionHistory.finish()`. After a provider failure, the next Start/Stop/quit stamps `endedAt`, which inflates the recorded duration. The end-of-session pair is also duplicated in `stores.ts`, `sessionController.ts` and `quit.ts`. | One `endTranscriptSession()` in `stores.ts`, called from all three places and when `isRunning` drops to false. Confirm the intended behaviour first. | S |
| D8 | Low | **Transcript monitor state resets on Start/Stop.** `TranscriptMonitor` is mounted in two branches ([`+page.svelte:1345, 1510`](../src/routes/+page.svelte)), so the chosen export format and follow/scroll state are lost at every transition. | Hoist to one instance outside the `{#if $isRunning}` branch. | S |
| D9 | Low | **Rail width cap misses child components** (verified). `.rail > *` ([`+page.svelte:1936`](../src/routes/+page.svelte)) is scoped. `MeetingProfiles` therefore stretches to full width in the stacked layout at larger Windows text sizes, while its siblings stay at 23.75 em. The same trap will catch every component extracted from the rail. | `.rail > :global(*)`. Do this before any extraction. | S |
| D10 | Decision | **`panic = "abort"` disables the recovery paths the code relies on.** The `join().is_err()` handling ([`session.rs:551, 583`](../src-tauri/src/session.rs)), `JoinError` paths and poison recovery are dead in release. A panic in any capture/provider thread kills the process, and the transcript lives in the renderer (the recovery spool is off by default). | Drop `panic = "abort"`, or keep it and document the trade-off. Measured cost of dropping it: +78% executable size (+43% compressed); see the batch 2 notes. | S |

## 2. Efficiency

| ID | Finding | Change | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | **Release builds link three crate types.** `crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib", "rlib"]` ([`Cargo.toml:17`](../src-tauri/Cargo.toml)) is the mobile template default. Each release build does separate fat-LTO links, including a 152 MB unused `.lib` and an unused DLL. | `crate-type = ["rlib"]` (the app is Windows-only). Build-time gain only. | S |
| E2 | **Tray menu rewritten every second** (verified). The effect at [`+page.svelte:311-323`](../src/routes/+page.svelte) depends on `elapsedMs`. Each tick sends all six labels. Each `set_text` is a blocking main-thread round trip made from a Tokio worker while a `std::Mutex` is held ([`tray.rs:75-100`](../src-tauri/src/tray.rs)). | Send labels only when the locale or overlay changes, and send the status line separately. In Rust, cache the last-applied values and make the command synchronous. | S |
| E3 | **Caption fitting lays out oversized candidates.** `fitCaptionTail` binary-searches over up to 12k characters of lead plus the current turn. That is about 12 `getBoundingClientRect` calls per origin per partial caption, and the first probes are 6k+ character paragraphs. `lineHeight` is re-read via `getComputedStyle` every run ([`OverlayCaptionLine.svelte:36-53`](../src/routes/overlay/OverlayCaptionLine.svelte)). Frame cost is *unmeasured*. | Pre-cut to an estimated tail from box area ÷ glyph area × 2 before searching. Cache line height per `fontKey`. | S |
| E4 | **Caption strings cloned on every emit.** `realtime.rs:503-504` clones both accumulated strings per interim caption, so the cost grows quadratically with turn length. Gemini binary frames are also copied before parsing ([`realtime.rs:418`](../src-tauri/src/realtime.rs), `bytes.to_vec()`). | Borrow `&str` in `Caption`. Use `std::str::from_utf8(&bytes)`. | S |
| E5 | **Activity bookkeeping at audio-meter rate.** `noteActivity` runs on every level event (20–40 Hz, [`+page.svelte:250`](../src/routes/+page.svelte)), but the labels it feeds change on a 1 s tick with 3 s thresholds. | Skip if the last note for that source is < 1 s old. | S |
| E6 | **History search re-normalises every line on every keystroke** ([`historySearch.ts:17`](../src/lib/historySearch.ts)). With 50 sessions that is ≈85 ms per keystroke. | Cache a normalised search string per session at decode time. | S |
| E7 | **Every transcript paragraph stays in the DOM.** The monitor also re-groups the full array per final line. At 5,000 lines the grouping is only 0.19 ms; the DOM size is the real cost (*unmeasured*). | Measure first. Then render the recent tail with a "show earlier" control, or use `content-visibility: auto` on paragraphs. | M |
| E8 | **348 KB of `.woff` fonts ship but are never loaded.** WebView2 always takes the `.woff2`. There are 54 font files for 7 weights × 3 subsets × 2 formats. | Declare `@font-face` for `.woff2` only, or switch Archivo to `@fontsource-variable/archivo` (one file per subset for all weights). | S |
| E9 | **Smaller Rust hot-path items.** The redundant `resampled` buffer in `capture.rs:269, 340` (the resampler already appends). Loopback `get_state()` runs at ≈100 Hz (`loopback.rs:165-174`). The overlay keep-on-top loop makes two main-thread round trips every 500 ms (`overlay.rs:107-114`). The keychain read blocks the async runtime inside the lifecycle lock (`session.rs:176`). | Write straight into `pending`. Throttle the state checks to 1 Hz. Fold the visibility check into the main-thread closure. Use `spawn_blocking` for the keychain. | S each |
| E10 | **Dev loop.** Vitest takes 41 s, 67 % of it environment setup across 42 isolated workers. CI's `rust` job `needs: frontend`, although it builds the frontend itself. | Try `isolate: false` on the `logic` project only (*unverified*; module-level stores may leak between files). Drop the `needs` so the Windows Rust lane starts immediately. The `windows-speech-v1` cache key and comment are stale. | S |

**Dead code:**
- `latestCaption` ([`stores.ts:149`](../src/lib/stores.ts)) is written on every caption and never read.
- `prepare_ondevice_model` is still registered and has a `tauri.ts:65` wrapper, but has no caller.
- `const open = true` in `TranscriptHistory.svelte:27`.
- The locale is pushed twice on mount (`+page.svelte:240, 474-478`).

## 3. Refactoring

### Rust core

- **R1 — Make the provider handlers pure.** Each client calls `emit_caption`/`next_turn` itself (`gemini/client.rs:115`, `openai/client.rs:113`, `mistral/client.rs:98`, `gemini/transcribe.rs:114`). Because they need an `AppHandle`, **Gemini Translate, OpenAI and Mistral handlers have no tests**. That includes Mistral's delta/done duplication guard. Change: return `CaptionUpdate { None, Interim, Final }` in `MessageOutcome` and let the runner emit. Optionally coalesce interims to ≈10 Hz there. M; risk medium (ordering), so add the tests in the same change.
- **R2 — Split `SessionManager::start`** ([`session.rs:147-415`](../src-tauri/src/session.rs), 269 lines). Five near-identical provider arms become a generic `spawn_realtime<P: RealtimeProtocol>`. The capture-thread `match`, level forwarder and join blocks are duplicated in `start_test` and become `run_capture`, `spawn_level_forwarder` and `join_threads`. Pairs with D5. M.
- **R3 — Small shared helpers, not a new abstraction.** `realtime.rs` already holds the connect/backoff/drain skeleton well. The remaining ≈50 duplicated lines become `bearer_request()`, `gemini_request()`, `parse_or_log<T>()` and `ServerMessage::control()`. The `export.rs` `atomic_write` duplicates `recovery.rs` `replace_snapshot`. The ten microphone sample-format arms (`capture.rs:133-229`) become one generic `build::<T: SizedSample>`. S.
- **R4 — Error consistency.** `recovery.rs`, `history.rs` and `lifecycle.rs:132` return English `String` errors instead of `AppError` ids. `{path:?}` shows operators doubled backslashes (`recovery.rs:110, 113, 147, 151, 177, 179`); use `.display()`. M.
- **R5 — Naming.**
  - Replace `MessageOutcome`'s two booleans with an enum.
  - `MistralConfig.received_delta` is runtime state on a config struct.
  - `TurnAccumulator.translated` also holds transcription text.
  - `emit_status` and the COM `Apartment` guard are each duplicated.
  - The crate doc in `lib.rs:1-5` still says Gemini-only.
  - Pedantic clippy flags `capture.rs:99` (138 lines), `realtime.rs:266` (122 lines, which splits cleanly into `await_setup` + `pump`) and `loopback.rs:67` (102 lines).

### Frontend state

- **R6 — One appearance schema.** The eight appearance settings are listed by hand in about seven places: controller push/reset, `CaptionAppearance`'s defaults check, profile save/load, `profiles.ts`, `OverlayConfig` (with different field names) and the overlay's init. The defaults (38, 30, 4, `'fit'`, `'archivo'`) are repeated as literals, so adding one setting takes about ten edits. Change: `DEFAULT_APPEARANCE`, `normalizeAppearance()` and `toOverlayConfig()`, ideally backed by one `appearance` store. Presets move to a `PRESETS` table shared with `CaptionPreview`. M.
- **R7 — A `persisted(key, parse, serialize)` helper.** It replaces 13 `writable(loadX())` + `subscribe(setItem)` pairs in `stores.ts` and five identical boolean loaders, and applies one try/catch policy (today only `languageFavourites` has one). S.
- **R8 — Decouple history from the recovery format.** `decodeSession` parses twice and validates against `RECOVERY_VERSION` ([`history.ts:33-34`](../src/lib/history.ts)). Bumping the recovery format would make every saved history session read as "unreadable". Change: export `readLines(unknown)` from `document.ts`, with each decoder checking its own version. S.
- **R9 — Contract tests for shared names.** `errors.test.ts` already cross-checks error ids against Rust. Add the same `readFileSync` check for `tauri.ts` command names against `command_names.rs`, `EVT` against `types.rs` events, and the TS unions against the serde enums. Also reuse `Locale`/`ORIGINS`/mode lists instead of re-declaring them. S.
- **R10 — Controller classes.** The three `.svelte.ts` controllers return long hand-written getter lists. Classes with `$state` fields remove about 100 lines. The store/runes mix itself is fine: keep shared state in stores and page-scoped state in runes. S/M.

### Component layer

- **R11 — Split `+page.svelte`** (2,846 lines: script 553, markup 1,130, **style 1,163**). Prerequisites: move the repeated utility classes to `app.css` and apply the D9 `:global` fix. The repeated classes are `.kicker` (3 definitions), `.hint` (6 definitions in 5 variants), `.divider`, `.key`/`kbd` (3 styles) and `.grow`. Suggested order, cheapest first:

  | Unit | Moves | Risk |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `SettingsDialog.svelte` + `Tabs` primitive | 578-639, 1543-1648, ≈215 CSS lines; removes the `% 4` magic numbers | low |
  | `OperatorTitlebar.svelte`, `SessionControls.svelte`, `DeviceRecoveryBanner.svelte`, `LiveTurns.svelte` | ≈450 lines together | low |
  | `PreflightChecklist.svelte` + `ChecklistRow.svelte` | 1351-1537 plus `ApiKeyPanel`'s copy of the row styles | low–medium |
  | `LiveRail.svelte` | 803-961, ≈310 CSS lines | low–medium |
  | `SetupSheet.svelte` + `ChoiceButton` | 962-1281, ≈570 CSS lines | medium |

  Script modules follow the existing controller pattern: `sessionClock`, `deviceFailure`, `recoveryOffer`, `nativeSync` and `setupActions`. The page should end at about 500–600 lines. `deviceRecovery.svelte.test.ts` renders the whole page and will catch regressions.
- **R12 — Split the overlay route** (939 lines):
  - `overlayCaptions.svelte.ts`: per-origin state, timers, presenter and `lines`. This makes it testable without font and `ResizeObserver` stubs.
  - `overlayPlacement.ts`: window moves and the key map.
  - `OverlayMoveChrome.svelte`.
  - `overlayFixtures.ts`.

  `captionColour.test.ts:310` reads these files by path; update its list.
- **R13 — Use the primitives that already exist.** `ui/` primitives are used in only four components.
  - **Stepper:** built by hand in `CaptionAppearance` and the overlay toolbar. It needs `format` and button-label props first.
  - **Select/Field:** the microphone select has no visible label; also the typeface select and `SystemCapturePicker`'s three hand-built fields.
  - **Preference:** the close-to-tray and recovery checkboxes.
  - **ToolButton:** the ghost button is defined three times identically. It needs `variant`, `size` and `wide` props.
  - **New primitives:** `ChoiceButton` (the two mode cards are identical 36-line blocks), `ChecklistRow`, `Icon` (21 inline SVGs in `+page.svelte`; the check path is copied six times) and `Kbd`.
- **R14 — Effects that should be derived values.**
  - `LanguagePicker.svelte:43-46` writes state it reads.
  - `+page.svelte:148-150` mirrors a global `hasKey` store that only this page uses.
  - `DateField.svelte:8-11`.
  - The Start button's disabled logic is written three slightly different ways; make one `canStart`.

## 4. Visual design

The operator UI is coherent and carefully accessible: a single focus ring, forced-colours
support, a contrast-tested palette, and an em-based container query that follows Windows text
size. The opportunities are mostly consolidation. The design system has grown by accretion,
and the tokens no longer describe what they render.

- **V1 — Collapse the type ramp.** `app.css` defines 16 `--type-*` tokens, but four of them
  (`--type-9-5`, `-10`, `-10-5`, `-11`) all render 11 px, so the pixel names are wrong. The idle
  operator screen renders **12 distinct sizes**. Half-pixel pairs (11/11.5, 12/12.5, 13/13.5)
  are indistinguishable at a glance and read as inconsistency rather than hierarchy. Proposal:
  seven role tokens, updating `typeScale.test.ts` to enforce the smaller set.

  | Role | Size |
  | --- | --- |
  | `caption` | 11 |
  | `small` | 12 |
  | `body` | 13 |
  | `label` | 14 |
  | `title` | 17 |
  | `heading` | 21 |
  | `display` | 27 |
- **V2 — Collapse the grey ramp and remove legacy aliases.** Text uses seven greys, including
  near-duplicates:
  - `--muted` `#8b93a1`, `--muted-2` `#848c99` and `--muted-3` `#7d858f`;
  - `--text-soft` `#c3c9d2` and `--text-dim` `#b9c0ca`.

  `--accent-2`, `--accent-soft` and `--focus` are all `#7fdcb6`. `--panel`/`--panel-2` and
  `--hairline`/`--border-2` differ by 3 RGB steps. Proposal: four text levels (bright, body,
  secondary, muted ≥ 4.5:1), three surfaces and two lines. Then delete the legacy names; the
  `app.css` header already calls them legacy.
- **V3 — Add spacing and radius tokens.** Components use 22 distinct px spacing values alongside
  25 rem/em values, and 9 hard-coded radii (3–20 px) beside the two radius tokens. A
  4-px-based scale (`--space-1…6`) and a `--radius-sm` for chips/kbd would absorb nearly all
  of them.
- **V4 — Bring overlay chrome under the palette tests.** Move-mode styles in
  `overlay/+page.svelte:686-920` hold 27 hex literals, at least 10 of them exact copies of
  tokens. They sit outside `palette.test.ts`'s contrast guard. The comment says the overlay
  "does not inherit the operator's surfaces", but `+layout.svelte` already loads `app.css`
  there.
- **V5 — One toolbar instead of three horizontal strips.** Under the native Windows title bar
  (which already says "Live Translation & Subtitles"), the app draws its own title bar with the
  same name, a subtitle, the status pill and the gear. Below that comes the Start/Rehearse bar.
  That is ≈140 px of chrome on a 660 px minimum-height window. Proposal: one bar:

  `[brand mark] [Start] [Rehearse]   …   [status pill + elapsed] [⚙]`

  Status then sits next to the control that changes it, and the stage gains ≈40 px.
- **V6 — Attach the keyboard hint to its action.** The `Ctrl Shift Space` chip floats after
  Rehearse and reads as a third button. It is also hard-coded English, written in two formats
  across `+page.svelte:786` and `KeyboardHelp.svelte:9-15`. Show it as secondary text inside the
  Start button or its tooltip, add `aria-keyshortcuts`, and source it from `shortcuts.ts` and
  i18n.
- **V7 — One primary and one ghost button.** The mint gradient primary is defined three times
  (`.start`, `ApiKeyPanel .save`, overlay `.primary`), while `ModalPrompt`'s primary is flat
  `--accent`. The ghost button is defined three times. Disabled opacity is 0.5 globally and 0.45
  in two places. Folding these into `ToolButton` variants (R13) settles them.
- **V8 — Smaller polish items:**
  - **Colour swatches:** screen readers announce raw hex ("#fff0b3"), and the selected state is
    drawn exactly like the focus ring. Use named colours and a distinct selected mark (check or
    inner ring).
  - **Small targets:** the typeface select is 12.5 px tall (fixed by D6), Reset is 24 px and
    Move overlay is 27 px. Aim for ≥ 32 px in a mouse-first desktop app.
  - **Dialog breakpoints:** settings-dialog breakpoints use viewport px (`CaptionAppearance:234`,
    `TranscriptHistory:365`). The dialog is 52 em wide, so at 225 % text size those breakpoints
    fire at the wrong point. Declare a container on `.prompt` and use em queries.
  - **Label mismatch:** the profile picker's visible label is "Meeting profiles" but its
    accessible name is "Choose a profile" (WCAG 2.5.3).
  - **Store screenshots:** these predate 1.4.x (the old app name, bottom Start button and
    single-page Settings). This is already tracked in `docs/store-screenshots/README.md`.

## 5. Keep as is

- The shared realtime runner: setup, jittered backoff, fatal-HTTP classification, stale-audio
  drain and the drop guard.
- Bounded `try_send` from audio callbacks.
- Staged file replacement.
- The lean dependency set and the size-tuned release profile.
- The newest-first transcript array: it costs 0.11 ms per prepend at 5,000 lines, and
  `saveDocument` relies on replacement.
- The recovery coordinator.
- The `.svelte.ts` controller pattern with explicit `dispose`.
- The type-scale and palette tests.
- Keyed `{#each}` everywhere.
- `LevelMeter`'s transform-only animation.
- Forced-colours support.
- `Messages = typeof en` plus the Rust error-id contract test.
- Tauri only delivers events to webviews that listen, so the overlay does not pay for 20 Hz
  meter events.

## 6. Suggested batches
