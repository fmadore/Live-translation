# Roadmap

GitHub milestones are the source of truth for active work. This file holds the current status,
the open work and a short record of what each release shipped; the
[release notes](docs/release-notes.md), the [Store handoffs](docs/store-updates.md) and git
history keep the detail.

## Current status — 1.7.0 in preparation, 1.6.0 in the Store

**1.7.0** is prepared and not yet tagged: [#116](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/pull/116)–[#122](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/pull/122),
the six batches of the [6 October app review](docs/app-review-2026-10-06.md) and a Mistral
reconnect fix. For operators it brings offline translation into English with Whisper (F1),
an overlay that reopens where it was last placed on each display layout (F2), cloud sessions
that reconnect after a mid-stream close, a transient provider error or a stalled network, and
Whisper built with SIMD behind a runtime processor check: about twice as fast on ARM64, and on
x64 limited to processors with AVX2. The rest is operator fixes, 24-bit microphones, structure,
and CI gates with two Playwright suites. The
[1.7.0 handoff](docs/store-updates.md#release-170-handoff) lists the release-candidate checks
(`v1.7.0-rc.1`) and the Store steps. Citation metadata records 1.7.0 with a provisional date of
7 October 2026, to be corrected if the tag lands on another day.

The latest [GitHub release is **1.6.1**](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/releases/tag/v1.6.1) (6 October 2026):
the wave-to-words icon ([#111](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/pull/111)) and the
5 October design review ([#112](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/pull/112)). It was
never submitted to the Store and will not be: 1.7.0 supersedes it there and carries its changes.

The Store serves [**1.6.0**](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
(MSIX 1.6.0.0), confirmed live by the maintainer on 6 October 2026. The [1.6.0 handoff](docs/store-updates.md#release-160-handoff) records its
status and the native checks still open against the Store build; its package evidence is in
that file's git history.

Store copy leads with offline captions and optional cloud translation; the scripted demo stays
available as a setup-free display check. Fresh installs select Whisper with Base and automatic
detection, while upgrades preserve saved setups.

## Open verification

The code for these has landed; what remains is evidence from Windows hardware, an installed
package or a native speaker, kept distinct from unit and fixture tests. The
[1.7.0 handoff](docs/store-updates.md#release-170-handoff) is the current checklist.

- **Local Whisper:** live hardware, language and Store-package checks
  ([local Whisper](docs/local-whisper.md)), now including Small translating real speech into
  English, the speed of the SIMD builds on x64 and ARM64, an x64 PC without AVX2, a model
  download behind a proxy and quitting with a large backlog.
- **Cloud session resilience** (6 October review, batches 1–2): a live handover, an OpenAI
  session past 60 minutes, Gemini Translate's answer to `audioStreamEnd`, pong replies from
  every provider and Mistral's real `error` payloads.
- **Cloud caption languages** ([#78](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/78)):
  live endpoint and speech acceptance ([language coverage](docs/language-coverage.md)).
- **Accessibility and tray** ([#24](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/24),
  [#22](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/22)): the Narrator, contrast-theme
  and text-scaling walks in [accessibility](docs/accessibility.md#release-checklist-manual-on-windows),
  and keyboard and Narrator operation of the tray menu. Text scaling at the 980 × 660 minimum
  has been verified only in a browser preview at a forced factor, not with the Windows slider.
- **French and German Store listings** (French:
  [#23](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/23)): final-package screenshots and
  a native-speaker review of the catalog and Store copy ([localization](docs/localization.md)).
- **Audio** ([#27](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/27),
  [#28](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/28)): the application isolation
  matrix and the [hardware matrix](docs/audio-device-testing.md) — Teams/Zoom, browser child
  processes, device changes, sleep/wake and mixed-DPI displays. System capture on wasapi 0.24
  has never run on hardware, and a 24-bit microphone has not been tried.
- **Export and responsive captions** ([#26](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/26),
  [#77](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/77)): the remaining
  [export checks](docs/transcript-export.md); user feedback, packaged Windows checks and fresh
  screenshots for the [caption layout](docs/caption-layout.md), including the overlay's restore
  across launches with a 150% laptop and a 100% projector.

## Planning conventions

- A milestone is a release outcome, not a promised date.
- Each active issue owns one independently testable change and carries its acceptance criteria.
- High-priority correctness, data-safety, and build work lands before optional features in the
  same milestone.
- Windows behavior is verified in an installed MSIX as well as browser/Tauri development; audio
  changes also require real hardware and a meeting-app test.
- Experimental Windows APIs remain outside Store builds until Microsoft documents them as stable
  and Store-eligible.

## Unscheduled and research

- [#32 — Windows AI speech-recognition prototype](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/32)
  stays unmilestoned and is blocked on evidence: it crashed natively on the target ARM64
  Surface during the 1.0.x certification attempts, must survive a clean ARM64 and a clean x64
  machine before it is considered, and cannot enter a Store build while the API is experimental.
- [#12 — automatic FR ⇄ EN direction](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/12)
  needs a measured provider-switching design before it becomes a release commitment. Two
  caption languages already serve the bilingual room: both directions run side by side, at
  twice the cost, with no switching to get wrong.
- Multi-monitor overlay presets: named placements to switch between in a running session, such
  as "bottom of the projector" and "top of the laptop". The overlay already reopens where it was
  last placed on each display arrangement, clamped to a connected display, and a meeting
  profile already carries a placement with its setup; what remains is choosing among several
  without a profile and without move mode, and moving the overlay when a display is connected
  mid-session.
- Per-origin caption styling on the overlay, such as a subtle prefix when both sources are live.
- Make rate-card verification dates visible: the rates in `providers.ts` have no in-repo source
  or date, and Mistral's realtime price is no longer on its pricing page
  ([6 October review](docs/app-review-2026-10-06.md#5-dependencies-and-provider-drift)).
- The other feature candidates of the
  [6 October review](docs/app-review-2026-10-06.md#6-feature-candidates), beyond #12 (its F3)
  and per-origin styling (F5): captions on attendees' phones over the LAN and an OBS mode (F4),
  small provider adoptions (F6), an opt-in transcript polish after the session (F7) and
  research into local text translation (F8).
- A billable provider smoke workflow: an explicitly manual run of live credentials against a
  golden audio fixture. It is intentionally not automatic because it costs money and CI secrets
  are not available to forked pull requests.

  78 Gemini and 13 OpenAI targets, including German
  ([#56](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/56)).

  tabbed Settings, profile picker, history browser, presets and swatches, localized tray labels
  and date fields.
- **1.4.0** (19 September 2026): [meeting profiles, reading controls](docs/usability.md),
  history titles and search, live input status, keyboard shortcuts and Gemini subtitle
  corrections.

  Stable reading, the overlay filler-word filter and the German interface.
- **1.2.3–1.2.4:** native Save As with SRT/VTT export (#26), application audio capture (#27)
  and the responsive caption layout (#77).
- **1.2.1–1.2.2:** device lifecycle and output selection (#28), Jump to latest, shorter
  transcript paragraphs, per-source handling of fatal provider errors and atomic recovery
  snapshots.
- **1.2.0:** the French interface (#23); operator-chosen caption typeface, colours and width
  ([#54](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/54),
  [#55](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/55)) with a composite contrast
  readout; a settings panel; the accessibility pass, including Windows text scaling (#24);
  caption timestamps; and separate operator and overlay capabilities
  ([#31](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/31)).
- **1.1.0** (27 August 2026, the first Store update): Gemini Transcribe Live as a second
  subtitle engine; the transcript as a document with an optional recovery spool
  ([#25](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/25)); a system tray with safe
  close and quit (#22); a truthful audio preflight
  ([#20](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/20)); F2 no longer promises a
  mid-session direction flip ([#21](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/21));
  no Tauri IPC calls in browser previews
  ([#29](https://github.com/fmadore/Live-translation/issues/29)).
- **1.0.5** (first Store certification): MSIX packaging, the privacy policy and a keyless
  default path. Store policy 10.8.3 bars individual accounts from requiring API keys for primary
  functionality, and policy 10.3 requires certification to be able to test the app. On-device
  recognizers failed on unconfigured review hardware, so 1.0.5 replaced them with a
  deterministic bundled demonstration and became native x64 and ARM64. The lesson stands for
  the next attempt: a keyless path that depends on the reviewer's hardware, language packs or
  privacy settings is not a keyless path. macOS support was dropped; the Linux CI lane is a
  compile check only. See [Microsoft Store submission](docs/microsoft-store.md).
- **0.4.0** (August 2026): Mistral Voxtral subtitles, plain-text and Markdown export, current
  provider contracts, a serialized start/stop lifecycle, bounded audio channels, frontend
  tests, Windows and Linux Rust CI with npm/RustSec audits.
- **0.3.0:** fixes from the July and August 2026 reviews — per-origin status and captions,
  capture-error reporting, a shared realtime session runner with backoff reset and fail-fast
  handshakes, stale audio dropped before reconnecting, async commands, overlay move mode and
  the first CI workflow.
