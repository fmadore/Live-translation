//! Window close and application quit.
//!
//! Everything that decides what clicking X, or Quit in the tray, actually does. It started
//! in `recovery.rs` as the guard that protected an unsaved transcript (issue #25); with a
//! tray in the picture (issue #22) closing can also mean *keep running*, and that decision
//! belongs next to the rest of it rather than inside the recovery spool.
//!
//! The invariant that matters: a live caption session is never ended, and unsaved captions
//! are never dropped, as a side effect of a window closing — while the window itself can
//! always still be closed, even if the front-end has stopped answering.
