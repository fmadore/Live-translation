//! Audio capture: microphone (cpal, cross-platform) and system loopback (WASAPI, Windows).
//! Both feed a uniform stream of mono PCM-16 chunks to the active translation client at the
//! provider's input rate (16 kHz for Gemini, 24 kHz for OpenAI), and emit a level meter to the
//! UI. The target rate is chosen per session and threaded into capture.
//!
//! `fixture` is a third source of the same stream, standing in for a capture device: it plays
//! a bundled recording so rehearsal mode exercises the pipeline with no audio hardware at all.
