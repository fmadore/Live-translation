//! What the core says when something goes wrong, in a form the front end can translate.
//!
//! The rule (issue #23): **the core names the failure, the interface words it.** A command or
//! a status event returns a stable id plus, where there is one, the untranslated technical
//! detail underneath it — a Windows error, a provider's own message, a path. The catalog in
//! `src/lib/i18n` owns the sentence; `describeError` in `src/lib/errors.ts` puts the two
//! together and falls back to the detail alone for an id it does not know, so a core that has
//! learned a new failure is never silent in an older interface.
//!
//! Ids are `dotted.lowerCamel`, grouped by what failed rather than by which command noticed.
//! `id_list` is read by a front-end test that checks the catalog has a sentence for each.
