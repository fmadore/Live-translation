//! Caption-overlay window behaviour: z-order and activation.
//!
//! `alwaysOnTop` only places the overlay in the OS "topmost" band — it does not win that
//! band. Any other topmost window (Zoom's meeting controls, a Teams call, a PowerPoint
//! slideshow, a browser in presentation mode) is drawn above the overlay as soon as it is
//! activated, which is exactly when captions matter most. So the overlay is re-raised to the
//! top of the topmost band on a short timer while it is visible.
//!
//! On Windows the overlay is also marked no-activate while it is click-through, so raising
//! it can never pull focus away from the presenter's application. That flag is cleared in
//! "Move overlay" mode, where the window has to be focusable to be dragged and resized.
