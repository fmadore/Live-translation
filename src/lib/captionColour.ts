/**
 * Operator-chosen caption colours, and the contrast check that keeps them readable.
 *
 * Issue #55 names the trap this module exists for. The overlay paints over a slide the app
 * does not control, through a scrim that is *semi-transparent* — so a ratio measured against
 * the scrim's own swatch is optimistic, and a colour picker with no guard is a way to make
 * captions unreadable five minutes before a keynote.
 *
 * ## What the audience actually sees
 *
 * Four layers, and the check has to walk all of them:
 *
 * 1. **The slide.** Unknown and uncontrolled. Modelled as both extremes — a white deck and a
 *    black one — because a ratio that holds at both holds everywhere between.
 * 2. **The scrim**, at the opacity it has *under the text*, which is not the opacity the
 *    operator sets. The scrim is a gradient: strongest at the bottom edge and gone at the
 *    top, and the text sits over the thin part of it. See `SCRIM_AT_TEXT`.
 * 3. **The halo** — the tight dark `text-shadow` ringing every glyph. It is not decoration:
 *    it is the layer that makes white captions survive a bright slide, and leaving it out of
 *    the model condemns a design that demonstrably works. It is what abuts the glyph, so it
 *    is the local background contrast is measured against.
 * 4. **The ink**, which for the dimmed steps is the caption colour at an alpha, composited
 *    over the halo like everything else.
 *
 * ## Why the steps stay alphas
 *
 * The finalized line, the lead-in and the origin label are steps *down* from the live
 * caption. Expressing them as alphas of the chosen colour — rather than as fixed greys — is
 * what makes them follow it: they dim toward whatever is behind them, which is the meaning of
 * "a little less contrast". The grey-on-grey failure #55 warns about comes from alphas of
 * *white* surviving a colour change, and that is exactly what this replaces.
 *
 * ## The threshold
 *
 * 4.5:1, not the 3:1 WCAG allows for large text. `docs/accessibility.md` holds 4.5:1
 * everywhere else, and the one surface an audience reads from the back of a room is not the
 * place to hold less.
