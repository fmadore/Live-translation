/**
 * The typeface the audience reads, and how the app knows a face is actually there.
 *
 * Issue #55 left the route open: bundle more `@fontsource` families beside Archivo, or offer
 * faces Windows already ships. This picks the system faces, for three reasons.
 *
 * **Cost.** Every bundled weight is MSIX size for every user, including the ones who never
 * open this control. The overlay renders captions at weight 600, so a bundled face is not one
 * file but at least one per weight it is offered at.
 *
 * **No synthesized bold.** The worry with system faces was a fake bold at 40px, and it does
 * not arise. CSS font matching for a desired weight above 500 walks *up* first, so a family
 * with only 400 and 700 renders 600 as its real Bold. Segoe UI has a true Semibold. Nothing
 * offered here is synthesized.
 *
 * **Availability is checkable.** The remaining objection was that "Windows 11 ships it" is a
 * per-SKU assumption. It does not have to be assumed: `faceIsAvailable` measures the family
 * against the generic it would fall back to, which needs no permission and no Local Font
 * Access API. A face that is not installed never reaches the control.
 *
 * Every stack still ends in Archivo, which is bundled — so even a face that slips past the
 * probe degrades to the app's own type rather than to whatever the OS decides.
