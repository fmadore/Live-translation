// A stand-in for the Rust core, for tests that render a whole window.
//
// Built on Tauri's own `@tauri-apps/api/mocks` rather than on `vi.mock('./tauri')`, so the
// real `tauri.ts` runs: `isTauri()` is true, every command goes through `invoke` under its
// real name with its real arguments, and events reach the page through the real `listen`. A
// test plays the core's part by answering commands and emitting events the way `src-tauri`
// does, and can then check what the window asked of it.
//
// Test-only. Nothing outside a `*.test.ts` file imports this, so it never reaches the bundle.
