// Windows' *Make text bigger* slider does not reach web content inside WebView2, so the Rust
// side reads `UISettings.TextScaleFactor` and hands it over — see `src-tauri/src/textscale.rs`
// and docs/accessibility.md. All this module does with it is set one custom property; the
// `--fs-*` ramp in app.css multiplies every font size in the window by it, and `:root`'s own
// font size carries it into the `em` breakpoints that decide when the two columns stack.
//
// The overlay does not call this. Its captions are projected content sized for a room by the
// operator, the same reason it opts out of contrast themes.
